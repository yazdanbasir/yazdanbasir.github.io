                            <h2>A deep-dive into the need to detect gerrymandering</h2>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Forgive me for using a cliche but gerrymandering is truly everywhere. The various maps
                                that you have seen all throughout this project have reiterated that idea. This section
                                aims to humanize the scope of the project and establish the need for all this research,
                                methods, court cases, and activism against gerrymandering: there is no-one who isn’t
                                affected by it.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                A first aspect to consider is trust in the system. At a time when political polarization
                                is at its all time high, trust can be hard to come by. Democrats feel Republicans are
                                rigging the system at every turn in an effort to suppress the voices of certain voting
                                groups; Republicans feel that Democrats are committing widespread voting fraud and
                                tossing out conservative ballots. Any semblance of a shared reality was gone out of the
                                window a long time ago.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                None of the methods being used to detect gerrymandering is perfect and final. I
                                highlighted the limitations of EG but even MCMC has its flaws. The statement “Computing
                                will never make tough redistricting decisions for us and cannot produce an optimally
                                fair plan. But it can certify that a plan behaves as though selected just from the
                                stated rules. That alone can rein in the worst abuses and start to restore trust in the
                                system.” sums it up aptly.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                The detection methods are steps in the right direction, they are not the
                                be-all-and-end-all themselves: they need constant improvement, constant testing, and
                                constant trust to make real change in the world. In an age of hyperpartisanship, it is
                                one of our last hopes in ensuring fairness, mending the gap between the Democrat and
                                Republican parties, and enabling everyone to have a vote that matters and gives them
                                agency in the administration of this country.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                As long as gerrymandering can occur so blatantly and with impunity, it’s increasingly
                                likely that your vote is getting the wrong person in office. Consider this data from the
                                Center for American Progress:
                            </p>

                            <img src="/dhss/media/figure1.png" alt="Figure 1">

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Figure 1 tells us that “59 politicians that would not have been elected based on
                                statewide voter support for their party won anyway because the lines were drawn in their
                                favor—often by their allies in the Republican or Democratic Party”. That’s quite
                                troubling because it means the millions of people who voted for these seats, voted for
                                the wrong person to end up in the government. Their vote, in this case, went into a
                                blackbox, and churned out an unconstitutional victory for someone else. That’s more
                                unconstitutionally-won seats than the entirety of the state of California (which has 53
                                seats to begin with).
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                To quantify the “millions of people” I mentioned above, let’s consider the fact that, on
                                average, each congressional district in the US has about 700000 people. If 59 seats were
                                flipped, that means that gerrymandering violated the vote of 700000 x 59 = 41.3 million
                                voters. That’s approximately 20% (1/5th) of the entire registered voting population in
                                the US.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Letting this continue is synonymous with the message that our legislative and judiciary
                                bodies don’t really care that the votes of more than 40 million Americans are not
                                representative of their actual choices. That doesn’t really seem to be an ideal
                                compatible with the world’s oldest “democracy”, right?
                            </p>

                            <img src="/dhss/media/figure2.png" alt="Figure 2">

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Figure 2 gives us data from 2012 - 2016 and showcases that Republicans are winning 19
                                seats they shouldn’t be winning every single election. That’s 13.5 million votes that
                                are being misrepresented in these states.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Suppose the next elections have come up and before going out to vote, I tell you that
                                there’s a 20% chance your vote may elect the wrong person into office, how would you
                                react? Maybe you won’t go out to vote, maybe you’ll get scared to vote, or maybe, you’ll
                                just lose trust in the system. And I wouldn’t blame you, it would be completely natural
                                of you to think that way; after all, why do something when there’s an extremely high
                                chance that you’ll end up with the exact opposite of your intended result?
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Maybe that’s why people are so disillusioned with the current state of affairs. Maybe
                                that’s why about ~ 100 to 150 million don’t turn up to vote every election cycle. It’s
                                certainly one reason in the intricate web of narrative regarding democracy in the US.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Voter suppression along with keeping people out through gerrymandering is inexplicably
                                dangerous for the future of this country. The Brennan Center for Justice reports that a
                                minimum of 17 million registered voters had their votes nullified form 2016 to 2018 in
                                addition to the 16 million that were already nullified from 2014 to 2016. And it should
                                be of no surprise to any of us here that most of these registered voters are people of
                                color.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                There’s a cruel wheel that keeps turning behind all this. Once you’ve pushed someone out
                                of the voting process and gained a couple of seats in each place you do so, you’ve
                                created a self-fulfilling mechanism where you can keep power to keep people out and keep
                                people out to keep power. It’s a never-ending cycle that seems to have no end in sight
                                unless our models to detect gerrymandering are rapidly adopted by the courts and have
                                some faith placed in them to start doing some good - before we reach the point of no
                                return, that is.
                            </p>

                                As I said before, it's really not all doom and gloom. The research is making positive
                                incremental changes and <a

                                are not impossible. The whole country and all of the districts in it can be drawn up in
                                a way that is sufficiently optimal and does not leave anyone behind - it's just up to
                                the ones actually making the maps whether or not they want to play fair.
