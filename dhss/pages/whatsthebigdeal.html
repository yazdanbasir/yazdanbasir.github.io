                            <h2>What's so hard to detect about gerrymandering?</h2>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                After observing the examples in the last section, you wouldn’t be out of line to
                                inquire: “Well, if gerrymandered maps are unusually-shaped, why can’t we just toss out
                                all the weird looking maps?”
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Let me show you another example:
                            </p>

                            <img src="/dhss/media/nc2012.png" alt="North Carolina">

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                These are districts in North Carolina for the 2012 election. Most of them seem pretty
                                normal/organic in terms of their shape. However, while they may not look the part, these
                                districts are also heavily gerrymandered. And that’s the whole point I’m trying to make
                                here: being oddly-shaped isn’t enough evidence to conclude gerrymandering. Conversely,
                                being normally-shaped isn’t enough evidence to conclude a lack of gerrymandering. This
                                sword cuts both ways.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                I bring up this counterexample to highlight the initial complexity of this problem. We
                                can’t simply eyeball maps and toss them out if they look weird. It is certainly possible
                                that they were not gerrymandered at all. And similarly, we can’t approve a map because
                                it looks “normal” to us - it could be heavily gerrymandered. There are age-old adages
                                relevant to this situation: “all that glitters is not gold” and “never judge a book by
                                its cover.”
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                It’s only logical to then ask: “what’s the solution if we can’t use the eye-test? How do
                                we figure out whether or not a map is gerrymandered?”
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Thank you for asking - allow me to answer another question first and then get back to
                                that question (since it is the overarching question of this project). The other question
                                in this case is “what’s the big deal about gerrymandering? What’s so hard to detect in
                                the first place?”
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Now we’re talking. Earlier, through the counterexample, I highlighted the initial
                                complexity of determining gerrymandered maps; the idea that there is no level of
                                weirdness that can definitively tell us a map is rigged. Now we can build upon that
                                complexity and show that this problem is worse than you expected.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Consider a 2x2 grid representing a certain area in the US. Suppose I task you with
                                coming up with 2 continuous districts. How would you draw them? Well, there’s two ways:
                                you could draw both districts vertically or you could draw both districts horizontally.
                                Pretty simple, right?
                            </p>

                            <img src="/dhss/media/2x2.jpeg" alt="2x2 visual">

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Now consider a 3x3 grid where I ask you to come up with 3 districts. This would take
                                longer than the 2x2 grid but it’s still doable. If you put some thought into it, you’d
                                realize you can come up with 10 different ways to arrange the districts.
                            </p>

                            <img src="/dhss/media/3x3.jpeg" alt="3x3 visual">

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Let’s continue our fun little game. A 4x4 grid has 117 ways to arrange 4 districts. A
                                5x5 grid has 4006 ways to arrange 5 districts. A 6x6 grid has 451206 ways to arrange 6
                                districts. Things are starting to get a bit crazy now. To bring this game to an end, by
                                the time we get to a 9x9 grid, we face the overwhelming prospect of having
                                706152947468301 ways to arrange 9 districts - that’s more than 706 trillion
                                arrangements.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                That’s how many possibilities there can be to process when a potential gerrymander comes
                                to your attention. To make this “game” more realistic, let’s also consider possibilities
                                where districts can be of unequal size. As you can imagine, the problem gets
                                significantly worse. I’ll spare you the painstaking details so here’s a nice chart
                                showing the numbers:
                            </p>

                            <img src="/dhss/media/table.png" alt="Complexity Table">

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Throw ~330 million people into the equation, a two-party system, a lack of border and
                                boundary data, and the important fact that real maps aren’t neat grids like our examples
                                above, and you can see why this problem is impossible to keep up with. After a certain
                                point, detecting gerrymandering/processing redistricted maps is quite simply
                                incomputable - there is no way around that.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                That's an extremely scary realization to deal with, at least in my experience. Computers
                                & technology are supposed to be these omnipotent, inexhaustible machines that process
                                large amounts of data at speeds humans could only dream of, but even they have their
                                limitations. So, in the fight against partisan gerrymandering, we’re essentially capped
                                by the processing power of modern-day technology.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                As Ron Popeil would say: but wait...there’s more! The gerrymandering problem isn’t
                                difficult just because of how quickly it gets too complicated for our machines; we also
                                need to talk about how easy it is to gerrymander a map.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                While the new president of the US is from the Democratic Party and the Senate is a 50/50
                                split where the Vice-President (another Democrat) is a tie-breaking vote, the US is
                                still under Republican control for the most part. The Republican Party is in charge of
                                30 state legislatures, whereas Democrats are in control of 18. Similarly, the Republican
                                Party governs/controls 23 states in the country whereas Democrats control 15. Another
                                aspect to consider is the fact that ~54% of the state legislators in the country are
                                members of the Republican Party whereas ~45% are Democratic. That’s a lot of numbers
                                I’ve thrown at you but the point is that while the handful of people at the top are
                                Democrats, most of the country - on a day-to-day governing basis - is run by the
                                Republican Party. Therefore, it is not hard to understand why all the numbers & reports
                                point to the fact that Republicans are more fond of gerrymandering than Democrats; it’s
                                because they can. This represents a catch-22 situation where Republicans are in power
                                which allows them to gerrymander as they wish and because Republicans are free to
                                gerrymander as they wish, they are in power.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                The need to highlight Republican control in the country is to make the point that they
                                can gerrymander freely (because they control the states) and that there’s no
                                accountability when they do this gerrymandering (because they control the legislatures).
                                And that isn’t to stick it to Republicans and criticize them - Democrats have done and
                                do the exact same thing wherever they are in power and in control of the state
                                legislatures.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Let’s circle back to North Carolina. Two members of the Republican Party there - a
                                senator named Ralph Hise and a Representative named David Lewis - are prime examples of
                                how easy it is to gerrymander a map on party lines (i.e. partisan gerrymandering).
                                Senator Hise chaired the NC Senate Committee on Redistricting while Representative Lewis
                                chaired the NC House of Representatives Redistricting Committee. In an article for The
                                Atlantic, they wrote that the maps they had changed in NC were partisan and not racial,
                                which they were being accused of. The new maps they had drawn up were intended to
                                support the Republican Party in North Carolina, since they had won power there for the
                                first time in 140 years. Although they exploited loopholes in the Voting Rights Act and
                                the criteria it laid out, their map was rejected by a court on the basis of race. The
                                surprising bit was that in its decision, the court said the maps would’ve passed if
                                “politics, not race, was the driving factor.” What Hise and Lewis found out from this
                                process was that race could not be the primary factor when redistricting, although
                                politics could be - which was their intention from the start, anyways. So, their map was
                                rejected on a technicality because someone thought they were gerrymandering on the basis
                                of race, which they, by their own admission, were not. Secondly, Hise and Lewis noted
                                that they could have gone further and gerrymandered the map in a way that gave
                                Republicans an 11-2 advantage instead of the original 10-3 advantage and it would’ve
                                been passed just as easily. That’s incredibly dark and shows how broken, haphazard, and
                                inadequately prepared the system is to deal with issues like this.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Gerrymandering is also fairly easy to do on a technical level and not just a policy
                                level. Dr. Pablo Soberon from the City University of New York (CUNY for short) has done
                                some fantastic, yet scary, work in this area. There’s a field in mathematics called
                                topology, which essentially studies the properties of different objects/spaces when
                                their shape is changed (or deformed to be more accurate). <a
                                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-eJW0gEm5w" style="font-size:22px;">Here’s an

                                Anyways, Dr. Soberon’s area of interest is topology. He recently published a graduate
                                level article/paper where he detailed the simple topological approaches that could be
                                used to intentionally gerrymander a map.

                                Moving on. To sum up, we’ve established 2 key ideas so far. First, gerrymandering gets
                                unfathomably complex really fast and second, it’s quite easy to gerrymander a map and
                                get away with it in almost any circumstance, as Hise and Lewis show us. That’s a recipe
                                for disaster, right?
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Well, it gets even worse. To complete the triangle of doom, let’s take a look into how
                                the absence of a formal, working definition of gerrymandering leads to no-one doing
                                anything about it and paves the way for underground gerrymandering networks.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                This might sound weird but when it gets to the judicial level, no-one has any clue what
                                a gerrymandered map is. They don’t even know what “gerrymandering” is at that level.
                                That’s odd because we just defined the definition of gerrymandering in the last section.
                                So, how can it be that there’s no “definition” to work with?
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                It’s because a technical definition doesn’t help in identifying such maps when there are
                                so many factors involved. For starters, all maps are inherently different from each
                                other. That automatically makes the task of a standard definition quite tricky. And from
                                the last section, recall how many possibilities there are for possible gerrymanders -
                                where do you even begin looking when so many options are on the table? What’s the
                                difference in “gerrymandering” between an original map and one where its boundaries are
                                moved one mile to the right?
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                It would seem logical for the highest court in the country to take initiative on this
                                issue, given that it affects the whole country. However, back in June 2019, the Supreme
                                Court ruled - in pretty clear terms - that gerrymandering isn’t an issue they have to
                                deal with; it’s something states have to deal with “at the ballot box and in state
                                courts.” This represents another cruel catch-22 situation, as The Atlantic furthers,
                                where the people whose vote is suppressed by gerrymandering are being told that their
                                voice/action is what will put an end to gerrymandering.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                However, it isn’t that black and white. Going through the relevant court document (Rucho
                                v Common Cause 2019) reveals that The Supreme Court didn’t just shirk off their burden.
                                Far from it, actually. What the Court argued was that since there is no agreed upon
                                definition or standard of fairness regarding gerrymandering, it is not within the
                                court’s jurisdiction to solve it across the nation. In other words: the Supreme Court
                                doesn’t have a reliable toolkit by which they can strike down or approve maps that are
                                alleged to be gerrymanders. Many disagreed/protested against the decision, but it seems
                                to be an understandable one nonetheless.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                This lack of a working definition creates a power vacuum in the gerrymandering market
                                and opens avenues for exploitation. Around the time of the census, members of “The
                                League of Dangerous Mapmakers” travel across the country with their laptops with a
                                particular software for redistricting: Maptitude. Over the years, these dangerous
                                mapmakers have been identified to be key members of Republican Redistricting Committees
                                and included people like Tom Hoeffler, who had been gerrymandering districts in the US
                                for 40 years till his death in 2018. Hoeffler was notorious for going around the country
                                and giving presentations titled “What I’ve Learned About Redistricting - The Hard Way!”,
                                indoctrinating other like-minded individuals and Republican operatives into the dark
                                arts of gerrymandering.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Hoeffler and his crew are essentially gerrymandering mercenaries for hire - members of
                                the Republican Party pay for their services whenever needed and the impact really shows:
                                Hoeffler is personally responsible for some of the nastiest gerrymanders in the country
                                including states like Massachusetts, Florida, North Carolina, Alabama, Virginia,
                                Mississippi, and several others. His notorious, behind-the-scenes work in giving
                                Republicans power in the US has resulted in a majority Republican control in the country
                                and has earned him the infamous nickname “master of the modern gerrymander”.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Although Hoeffler died in 2018 and will not be involved in the 2021 redistricting
                                process, those he has trained in Republican Party will be. The League of Dangerous
                                Mapmakers’ invisible hand will continue to dictate the shape of districts in this
                                country and will cause further partisan plus racial divide and exacerbate the problem of
                                political polarization here. In fact, partisan gerrymandering has gotten so out of hand
                                that key Republican figures in redistricting committees are urging members, this week,
                                to scale back on their mapmaking and be more cautious in the entire process; “pigs get
                                fat, hogs get slaughtered” one member was quoted to say.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                To reiterate, all this is caused by the absence of an enforceable, court-compatible
                                standard for gerrymandering. And the overall problem can be summed up as: gerrymandering
                                is terrible for the country and it’s incredibly complex to keep track of, quite easy to
                                execute, and no-one in government has an idea where to begin stopping it. However, as
                                the overview of this project promised, there are a few mathematicians whose promising
                                work may be paving the way for a more equal, fair, and representative future for the
                                citizens of the US and beyond.
