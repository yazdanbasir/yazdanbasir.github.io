              <h2>Definition, Examples, Setup</h2>

              <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                On the 11th of February 1812, Elbridge Gerry - the governor of Massachusetts at the time - signed a bill
                into law approving the redistricting of Essex County. However, there was something different about this
                plan - it was quite bizarrely-shaped.
              </p>

              <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                This gave political satirists and cartoonists significant ammunition. Elbridge Gerry’s new map was now
                understood to be helping his party stay in power over the opposing Federalist Party. The Salem Gazette
                later ran an article with a giant salamander superimposed onto the approved map and called it “The
                Gerrymander: A New Species of Monster.”, with gerrymandering being a concatenation of “Gerry” and
                “Salamander”. They did so because Gerry’s map was so odd, it seemed to resemble a salamander.
              </p>

              <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                This was the first recorded instance of rigging elections/trying to stay in power by changing the map
                altogether. This practice is now called “gerrymandering” - a direct consequence of Elbridge Gerry’s
                greed - and it lets us define the term more formally, for the purposes of this project, before we move
                on.
              </p>

              <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                Gerrymandering is the act of redrawing maps/districts in a way that intentionally gives one side an
                unfair advantage over the other. In the modern day, this is usually done by policymakers, lawmakers, and
                public officials in state legislatures. Gerrymandering comes in many flavors: it can be partisan (along
                party lines, like Democrats/Republicans), racial (to divide people of different races), social, or even
                religious.
              </p>

              <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                In practical terms, gerrymandering comprises of two core strategies: packing and cracking.
              </p>

              <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                Packing involves crowding opposition voters into the fewest number of districts possible in order to
                lose the fewest number of seats possible. So, for example, if there are 10 districts in an area, you
                would want to pack all the opposition voters into 1 of those districts so you only lose 1 district and
                guarantee seats in the other 9 districts. Cracking is the opposite phenomena. You spread the opposition
                voters as thinly as possible across all districts to ensure they can’t accumulate enough votes to win
                over districts.
              </p>

              <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                Moving on, the salamander-shaped map from earlier may have made it obvious, but gerrymandered maps can
                look really, really weird. This may indicate that there was some foul play behind the scenes. Here’s an
                example of what they can look like:
              </p>

              <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                And this:
              </p>

              <img src="/dhss/media/maryland4.jpeg" alt="Maryland 4th District">

              <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                And even this:
              </p>

              <img src="/dhss/media/nc.jpeg" alt="North Carolina">

              <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                I could go on and on, but you get my point. There is an almost endless number of such districts
                throughout the history of the United States that I could put here. And that’s indicative of the larger
                problem at hand - it shows just how widespread this practice really is. The most disturbing bit is that
                most people have given up on putting an end to it. They’ve resigned to the idea that this is just part
                and parcel of politics and is a norm that comes with the census and a multiparty democractic system.
                However, just because our policymakers and state legislatures are ill-equipped to deal with the problem,
                that doesn’t mean there’s no substantial work going on. As you will learn through all the sections of
                this project, a handful of groups and individuals are leading the charge in the fight against partisan
                gerrymandering and ensuring that every vote matters, at the end of the day.
