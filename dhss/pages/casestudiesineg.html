                            <h2>An Analysis of Gill v Whitford</h2>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                The Gill v Whitford case from 2017 is a landmark case in the Supreme Court’s history and
                                in the fight against gerrymandering. Why? Because it was the first partisan
                                gerrymandering case that the Supreme Court agreed to hear in more than a decade (the
                                last one was in the mid-2000s when Justice Kennedy said that a workable standard for
                                gerrymandering needs to be developed by someone for cases like these to be solved at the
                                highest level).
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Gill v Whitford is also very important because of the clarification that was provided by
                                the litigators regarding the usage of the EG measure - there was a lot of hype and
                                misunderstanding around the EG measure that needed to be aired out. This hype can be
                                seen in the fact that even before the EG measure was tried in a real-world case like
                                Gill v Whitford, it was being touted as a “silver-bullet democracy theorem”, a
                                “gerrymandering miracle drug”, and the “holy grail of election law jurisprudence.”
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                The EG measure is an incredible tool to quantify gerrymandering and its results often
                                reach the same conclusions as other gerrymandering methods, especially MCMC. However, we
                                do need to apply the brakes a little bit here on the claims being made and the reason as
                                to why that needs to happen. I’ll make that case later on in this section but first
                                let’s take a look at the details of Gill v Whitford and how it went down.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Back in 2017, 12 Democratic voters in Wisconsin brought a case to the courts: they
                                argued that Wisconsin’s state legislature map from 2011 (seen below) was gerrymandered
                                against the Democratic Party. They said this under the orders of Governor Scott Walker,
                                who wanted to cement the Republican power gained in the state after the 2010 elections
                                by packing Democrats into the fewest number of districts. The Democrats based their case
                                on the idea that Democratic Party won 174000 more votes than the Republicans overall,
                                but the Republicans still walked away with a 60-39 majority in the state.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Despite all their claims, the Supreme Court struck down the plaintiffs’ argument. The
                                decision stated that the focus needed to be on the districts that were gerrymandered and
                                not in trying to prove the whole state was rigged as a whole. However, the Court did
                                send back the cause to the district court for reargument: there was enough evidence of
                                gerrymandering to warrant that, at least. Stephanopoulos and McGhee’s formula showed
                                that the state maps in 2011 had an EG of 13% and 10% in 2014, making both of them
                                unconstitutional.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                A similar theme from Rucho v Common Cause can be seen here - the Supreme Court simply
                                did not have an official standard to work with. In the official decision, Chief Justice
                                Roberts writes: “This is not the usual case. It concerns an unsettled kind of claim this
                                Court has not agreed upon, the contours and justiciability of which are unresolved. We
                                decline direct dismissal.”
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                While the case was struck down on technical aspects more than substantive aspects (<a
                                    href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1161_dc8f.pdf"
                                    style="font-size:22px;">full decision available here</a>), , it is another step in
                                the right direction. The EG measure continues to grow and bringing it in for a landmark
                                case says a lot about where this fight against gerrymandering is heading.
                            </p>


                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                But I promised you limitations of the measure - and there are many, unfortunately.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Efficiency Gap measures can be volatile in edge cases. If one party has an overwhelming
                                majority in a state, EG will label that as a case of widespread packing by that party.
                                This is explained by the idea that EG doesn’t necessarily take political geography into
                                account: “In Wisconsin, most Democrats are concentrated in cities like Milwaukee,
                                producing lopsided races there. To the efficiency gap, that could look like nefarious
                                packing, when in reality it’s simple demographics. Similarly, if several nearby
                                districts all swung toward one party in a close election year, that completely natural
                                outcome would get flagged as cracking”.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Another limitation of EG is that “in some cases, it leads to unintuitive conclusions.
                                For example, you’d think that a state where one party wins 60 percent of the vote and 60
                                percent of the seats did things right. Not so, according to the efficiency gap. If you
                                do the math, that state would get flagged for extreme partisan gerrymandering—in favor
                                of the losing party. Perversely, then, the easiest remedy might be to rig things so that
                                the minority party gets even fewer seats.”
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                A final note I’ll make of this is conceptual rather than technical and one that Moon
                                Duchin highlights brilliantly in her work: “gerrymandering is a fundamentally
                                multidimensional problem, so it is manifestly impossible to convert that into a single
                                number without a loss of information that is bound to produce many false positives or
                                false negatives for gerrymandering.” In essence, the EG is too simplistic, too
                                reductionist to be used as a solitary standard in detecting gerrymanders.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                It’s not all doom and gloom, however, In EG’s defense, it was never meant to be the
                                be-all-and-end-all of partisan gerrymandering detection - it was always meant to be used
                                in conjunction with other tools. This can be seen in the fact that while they were
                                laying out the case against the Wisconsin map, Stephanopoulos and McGhee didn’t just
                                rely on the EG; they took political geography into account, they made use of 200
                                simulations and ran elections in each of them, and still reached the same conclusion
                                that the Wisconsin map was an unconstitutional gerrymander.
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                It is this nuanced analysis in conjunction with other tools that is the whole point of
                                the EG measure, says Stephanopoulos. He furthers that “the true breakthrough in Whitford
                                isn’t that plaintiffs have finally managed to quantify gerrymandering. Rather, it’s that
                                they’ve used the efficiency gap (and other metrics) to analyze the Wisconsin plan in new
                                and powerful ways. These analyses are the real story of the litigation — not the
                                formulas that enabled them. Since 2004, the courts haven’t even been able to agree on a
                                test, rendering most lawsuits hopeless. However, in a 2006 case, five justices expressed
                                interest in statistical metrics that show how a plan benefits (or handicaps) a given
                                party. The efficiency gap is such a metric.”
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                Duchin’s critique of the EG measure wasn’t ill-intentioned, of course. It was a case of
                                a peer simply reviewing work that a like-minded individual had created. Duchin and her
                                colleague Mira Bernstein went on to write that the EG is “a famous formula can take on a
                                life of its own and this one will need to be watched closely”. The Atlantic also notes
                                that “the people who study the efficiency gap know its limitations. The real question is
                                whether the courts will also recognize those limits. The danger isn’t the efficiency gap
                                itself, but rather the temptation to look only at the efficiency gap, and make it the
                                effective definition of partisan gerrymandering in the future.”
                            </p>

                            <p align="justify" style="font-size:22px;">
                                So, there is a lot of work to be done and it is being done. Variations of the EG measure
                                are being developed and more and more court cases are popping up where expert testimony
                                involving the EG measure is being brought on board.
                            </p>

                                For the purposes of further reading, Stephanopoulos and McGhee wrote another paper that
                                addressed the concerns being raised against the EG measure. <a
