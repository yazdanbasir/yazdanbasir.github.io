        As the pass made its way to his feet, destiny propelled it up to the perfect height. It was a breakthrough for Spain after Robben’s miss at the opposite end of the pitch.

Then came una pausa.

Andres Iniesta struck the ball cleanly and put it in the back of the Dutch net, the hope of 47 million souls riding on his shoulders.

It was perfect.

It was chaos.

It was a beauty behind all the madness. The hell of the past few months were suddenly a lot less traumatic now – it was only fitting that the man who had been struggling with injury and depression the whole year and had barely made the World Cup squad would be responsible for Spain’s greatest ever footballing moment. And it was only fitting that this moment came on the grandest of stages in the world.
