					<h2>Lafayette Men's Soccer Dashboard</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					I worked as Lafayette Men's Soccer's first-ever data engineer and analyst.
					I developed a data processing pipeline that scraped, consolidated, and cleaned 
					the team's performance metrics from Wyscout and supplied it to a custom-built dashboard,
					where the various statistics could be filtered and visualized according to the
					needs of the coaches/team to inform training strategy and opponent analysis.

					<h2>PlayerNet</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Even though I've been watching soccer/football for more than a decade,
					I still stumble across players that I had no idea played with each other at some point.
					Therefore, I developed this tool to be able to search for a particular player and
					visualize when and how long they overlapped with all teammates across their career.

					<h2>NightSight</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					For as long as I can remember, I've had trouble falling asleep.
					So, I've always been curious to see what my sleeping patterns can tell me about
					my body and my habits. I've been tracking the data with a FitBit and built a
					dashboard to feed the metrics into where I can visualize, filter, and draw insights from
				 in order optimize my routine/well-being as desired.
