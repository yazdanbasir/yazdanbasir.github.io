					<h2>Lafayette Men's Soccer</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					I worked as the first-ever data engineer and analyst for Lafayette's Men's Soccer team.
					I developed a data processing pipeline that scraped, consolidated, and cleaned 
					the team's performance metrics from Wyscout and supplied it to a custom-built dashboard,
					where the various statistics could be filtered and visualized according to the
					needs of the coaches/team to inform training strategy and opponent analysis.
				</p>
				<p>Link to the tool. (Data anonymized for privacy)</p>

					<h2>PlayerNet</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Even though I've been watching soccer for more than a decade,
					I still stumble across players that I had no idea played with each other at some point.
					Therefore, I developed this fun tool to look up players and
					visualize when and how long they overlapped with their teammates across their career.

					<h2>NightSight</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					For as long as I can remember, I've had trouble falling asleep.
					So, I've always been curious to see what my sleeping patterns can tell me about
					my body and my habits. I've been tracking the data with a FitBit and built a
					dashboard to feed the metrics into where I can visualize, filter, and draw insights from
				 in order optimize my routine/well-being.

					<h2>Food Tasting</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					A web application to streamline the organization of one of Lafayette College's major annual events,
					Food Tasting (hosted by the International Students' Association). This project integrates Giant's
					inventory and automates, cleans up, and consolidates the process of ingredient submission, grocery
					shopping, and resource allocation for the big day!

					<h2>JRE Analyzer</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					I feel a bit hesitant saying this here, but I have been listening to the Joe Rogan Experience
					for many years now. I try to stick to the episodes with scientists/academics but have enjoyed other
					ones as well since the array of guests is so diverse. Anyway, I've noticed that no matter who is on,
					Joe manages to bring up the same topics and areas of conversation. So, I did some analysis of
					the episodes to see how often and when Joe's to-go topics come up :)
